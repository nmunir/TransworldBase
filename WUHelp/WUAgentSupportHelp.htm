<strong>HOW TO USE THE AGENT SUPPORT FACILITY</strong><br />

The Agent Support tab lets you request assistance from Western Union and view replies.<br />
<br />
Each request is referred to as a <strong>Conversation</strong> and can include several messages between you and Western Union.<br />
<br />
<strong>ABOUT CONVERSATIONS<br />
