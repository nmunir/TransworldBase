    <Title>Latest Trustpoint Customer Review</Title>
    <Text>Excellent - Will definitely use them again. Ordered a bike for my daughter's birthday, then realised I would not get it because of the Christmas holiday. I emailed bikesdirect and they pulled out the stops to dispatch it when they were closed! Customer service does not get much better than that. The bike arrived early, was the cheapest I could find on the Net, and my daughter loves it. Very pleased. (January 2012)</Text>
