    <Title>POS material - how to order a full kit</Title>
    <Text>We have added a new function to the ordering of POS material. If you wish to order a full kit, select a box label in your language, then view basket. The system will automatically recognise your choice of language and give you a list of associated products that you can add to the order. This prevents you from chosing products in the system and saves you time!  </Text>
