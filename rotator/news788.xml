    <Title>Ramdan 2012 Campaign</Title>
    <Text>The Ramadan Campaign message of ‘Send money and get the chance to share £25,000 – Generosity is in the air’ was chosen to emphasize the importance of giving and sharing which is intrinsic to the spirit of Ramadan. During this special time we will be running a promotion where at the end of the Ramadan period 20 senders will be drawn to win a £1,250 prize each, based on all valid and correct entries of sent transactions from the UK during the period 20th July to 19th August 2012. Terms &amp; Conditions apply.</Text>
