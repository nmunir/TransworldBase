			There was an incorrect use of the UniqueID property when rendering the editor 
			HTML. It was causing errors when running the editor over a User Control. It has 
			been fixed.
			<LI>
				The component now detects IE 5.5 browsers correctly. 
  Thanks to "chayes20".
  <LI>The references to fckeditor.js in the samples have been removed. There 
  were never required. It was just a "typo" in the sample 
pages.</LI></UL></SPAN>
